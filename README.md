# Pong Wars
I found an interesting project, [Pong Wars](https://github.com/vnglst/pong-wars) a few days ago.
As a practice, I implemented it in C++ with SFML.

## Requirements
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
- [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)
- a C++ compiler

## Quick Start
Configure the build directory & compile the program:
```sh
make config
make build
```

Run the program:
```sh
make run
```
